# Project docs

Having a top-level project README is good, but sometimes you also need other
docs too. This folder is where you'd put them.

You may need some or all of the following at your project grows

- Docs that describe your project architecture.
- Docs that describe operational concerns of your project, like to deploy
it to a production environment securely.
- Design docs that discuss how or why certain features work
- If you follow an [RFC-style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments)
process for new features they could live in a folder like `/docs/rfcs`. See
the [CockroachDB RFCS](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/tree/master/docs/RFCS)
for a great example of this in practise.
